### About Simplechart

Simplechart lets anyone quickly create interactive data visualizations that are easy to embed in any webpage.

It has been built to leverage a wide range of existing chart libaries like d3 with nvd3 or highcharts, or to easily add more.
Whether you want to build a simple chart from scratch, or to copy a data set from excel and tweak all the nitty-gritty options,
Simplechart can fill the gap where you would otherwise need a programmer or designer to get visualizations ready for the web.

Simplechart is alpha software. Check back as we continue to add features and improve the experience.
