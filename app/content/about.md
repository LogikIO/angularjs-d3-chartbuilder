<h3>About Chartbuilder</h3>

<div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
<p>Chartbuilder aims to simplify the process of turning your data into interactive visualization for the web. It has been built to leverage a wide range of existing chart libaries like d3 with nvd3 or highcharts, or to easily add more. Whether you want to build a simple chart from scratch, or to copy a data set from excel and tweak all the nitty-gritty options, Chartbuilder can fill the gap where you would otherwise need a programmer or designer to get visualizations ready for the web.</p>
<p>Chartbuilder is alpha software. Check back as we continue to add features and improve the experience.</p>
